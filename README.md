##### To build, compile and run please use the following command on root folder:

`gradle bootRun`

if you don't have `gradle > version 5` install in your computer I recommend you to install it
with SDKMAN:

`$ curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash`

`$ source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"`

`$ sdk version`

`$ sdk install gradle`

`$ gradle -version`

if gradle is not found you should set the env var:

export GRADLE_HOME=/home/<User>/.sdkman/candidates/gradle/current/bin/gradl
